Cloudinary
==========

Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that provides solutions for image and video management, including server or client-side upload, on-the-fly image and video transformations, quick CDN delivery, and a variety of asset management options.

Salesforce Commerce Cloud (formerly Demandware), is one of the industry's most agile and scalable e-commerce platforms. Cloudinary offers a certified Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) cartridge that enables you to simplify and automate the process of transforming, optimizing, finding and delivering metadata-enriched images and videos throughout your entire Commerce Cloud store, including product images and videos, category assets, and site catalogs.

## Setup ######################################################################

### Get your Cloudinary account information 

If you donâ€™t have a Cloudinary account, sign up for a [free account](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) so you can try out image and video transformations and seamless delivery through CDN.

Get your cloudname, api_key and api_secret from your Cloudinary account [as described here](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/how_to_integrate_cloudinary#account_details).

### Configuring the site cartridges

Cloudinary offers a site cartridge for each of SFCC's reference architectures: SiteGenesis, and Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA). Both have the same functionality, but are configured in different ways.  

#### SiteGenesis site cartridge

If you already have a storefront on SiteGenesis and you do not want to migrate to SFRA, then this is the cartridge for you. 

##### SiteGenesis site cartridge installation

You can download the certified SiteGenesis site cartridge from the [Cloudinary page](https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/cloudinary/) on the SFCC Link Marketplace (requires SFCC login). Installation and basic usage instructions are provided in the download - see **Cloudinary SiteGenesis LINK Documentation** in the documentation folder. 

You can also get [the most recent release](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_sfcc_site_cartridge/releases), and download the [Cloudinary SiteGenesis LINK Documentation](documentation/Cloudinary%20SiteGenesis%20LINK%20Documentation%201.0.0.docx) from this repo.

#### SFRA site cartridge

This is the recommended cartridge if you already have a storefront on SFRA, or are new to Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFRA is the more recent architecture).

##### SFRA site cartridge installation

You can download the certified SFRA site cartridge from the [Cloudinary page](https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/cloudinary/) on the SFCC Link Marketplace (requires SFCC login).
